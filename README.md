CoffeeMachine - A Coffee Machine Simulator

What can be better than a cup of coffee during a break? A coffee that user don’t have to make himself/herself. It’s enough to press a couple of buttons on the machine and user can get a cup of energy; but first, user should teach the machine how to do it. In this project, I have worked on programming a coffee machine simulator. The machine works with typical products: coffee, milk, sugar, and disposable cups; if it runs out of something, it shows a notification. User can get three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino, and latte. Since nothing’s for free, it also collects the money.
